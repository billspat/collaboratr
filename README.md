### Motivation

Performing a Meta-analysis requires collating and harmonizing data
extracted from many different sources but most frequently scientific
publications.  
Collaborative meta-analysis requires a group of scientists to
collectively develop and agree on their goals, type of data extracted,
format of the those data, and to do so extremely consistently across
papers. This package helps to support that efficiently by the
easy-to-use Google Sheets for data definition and data entry. The
workflow in this project can read directly from Google sheets into CSVs
and validate the structure of a google sheet as well as the data using
the Validate package.

<!-- insert description of the EDI data transform framework here -->

Originally, this This R package was part of 3 repositories that support
the data entry, validation and accumulation of a meta-analysis for a
research project sponsored by MSU IBEEM

1.  collaboratR: data management code for L0 and L0-\>L1 layer in EDI
    framework
2.  data: version controlled data collection for tracking provenance
    using git, this is the L0 and L1 layers in the EDI framework. the
    collaboratR package assists with data transfer and validation from
    Google drive into the data repository.
3.  analysis: R code for reproducible data analysis , L1-\>L2 layers in
    EDI framework, using data in the data repository.

## Installation - Package

- clone this repository into a [new Rstudio
  project](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/projects.html)
  and open it

- install required packages: This package uses
  [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to manage the packages you
  need to install, which creates an `renv.lock` file for you. 1. install
  the renv package: this can go into your R environment used for all
  packages.

  2.  in R run `renv::restore()` or if that complains about R versions

*additional packages are required to build the package and this website,
source the script* `R/install_dev_packages.R`

### Installation/Testing

Google drive in this package is set to interaction. To run any building,
installing or checking in R, you must first manually connect to google
drive, which must be set-up properly first.

See the vignette in this package “Google Sheets API setup using Google
Cloud”, or in this source code see [Google Sheets Vignette
RMD](vignettes/google_sheets_api.Rmd)

Once set-up you may have to log-in manually prior to running tests or
checks, use

``` r
source("R/gdrive.R")

## Data Google Drive Project Setup

See the Vignette ["Google Sheets API setup using Google Cloud"](vignettes/google_sheets_api.Rmd) 
for details about setting up google sheets connection with R, which requires
a google cloud project in your institution

Note that for safety, this package only reads from google drive and it never
writes to google drive.  Therefore it only requests 'read-only' access.

## Usage

When reading in data sheets, you provide a URL for a datasheet that exists in any folder that you have access to.   The system will attempt to log you into to google drive and requests your permission for this code to access files on your behalf.   

```R
gurl<- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6sYozjybyd53eeiTdigrRTonteQW2KXUNZNmEhQyM8/edit?gid=0#gid=0'
study_data<- read_commrules_sheet(gurl)
```
