*This is very early version under heavy development.*

This R package is part of 3 repositories that support the data entry, validation and accumulation of a meta-analysis for the commRULES project.  

1. commRULES data: version controlled data collection for tracking provenance using git, this is the L0 and L1  layers in the EDI framework
2. collaboratR: commRULES data management code for L0 and L0->L1 layer in EDI framework
3. commRULES-analysis: R code for reproducible data analysis , L1->L2 layers in EDI framework

## Installation - Package

This package uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to manage the packages you need to install, which creates an `renv.lock` file for you.  

- install RENV: this can go into your R environment used for all packages, so fire up R with now project select and `install.packages('renv')`
- clone this repository into a [new Rstudio project](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/projects.html) and open it
- inside the Rstudio project in the R console, `renv::restore()`

## Google Drive Project Setup

Using google drive via MSU seems to require creating a Google Cloud project, enabling the proper
APIs and and assigning permissions

Note that for safety, this package only reads from google drive and it never writes to google drive.  Therefore it only requests 'read-only' access.  

Full documentation for how to set this up is forthcoming

## Usage

When reading in data sheets, you provide a URL for a datasheet that exists in any folder that you have access to.   The system will attempt to log you into to google drive and requests your permission for this code to access files on your behalf.   

```R
gurl<- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w6sYozjybyd53eeiTdigrRTonteQW2KXUNZNmEhQyM8/edit?gid=0#gid=0'
study_data<- read_commrules_sheet(gurl)
```
